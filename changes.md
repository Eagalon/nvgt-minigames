New in build 1:
The readme has been updated. Aria2c was, and probably won't be, needed.
Finally! We have a launcher. Currently it is broken though.
The documentation viewer no longer imports speech.nvgt doubled.
Two developers added in the readme.
Guess the number game has been moved into an extra folder.
Documentation for number sort has been added.
Guess the number now uses form dialogs.
Documentation updated. Index updated to let it look not that ugly at start, and a documentation documentation added.
When the button d12 which closes the document reader is pressed after a document has been read, which is forcefully the case when an user wants to exit the documentation viewer, the form now resets before exiting. This don'T really needs to be done, but still.
A new todo (todo.md) has been added.
Readme updated so the version of nvgt is actually 0.86.0 instead of 0.86.1
Fixed two typos in the changelog.
The documentation of blackjack has been converted to plaintext and put into the documentation folder.
Fixed some spelling error at the readme.md
Documentation script has been updated.
Changes created.
