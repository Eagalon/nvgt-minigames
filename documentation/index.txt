What is NVGT Mini Games?
Let's split it up:
- NVGT is in short a game engine similar to bgt developed by Sam Tupy on git hub with lots of features. It allows it for users to create audio games or simple programs.
- Mini means or is another word for: Small, thiny.
- Games are things you can play, wether it is offline or online or in real life, that should be clear at all.

Together these form the words NVGT Mini Games. So these are a complilation of small and thiny games you can play offline.
