# Todo:
This is going to be a list with all things which still need to be done.

## Improving the UI of the document viewer:
This could look as follows:
Instead of the buttons we have to add every time if there is a new document, we could create an array containing all files in the folder documentation without the .txt extension. Then we create a form window, a list with the files, and an open button which forwards the file name as string to read_d(string document_name).
