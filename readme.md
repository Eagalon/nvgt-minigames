## NVGT Minigames
Welcome to NVGT Minigames, an ever-growing collection of small timewaster games created using the [Nonvisual Gaming Toolkit](https://github.com/samtupy/nvgt). Eventually, we hope to have games in all different categories, from math games, to puzzle games, to word games, and many more.
Additionally, this collection is open sourced, which means that anyone who wants to add a new game or fix errors in the project can do so, and anyone who wants to learn how any of the games work can look at their source code freely.
## Documentation
To view the documentation, you can either read it in your text editor of choice, or you can view the documentation from the documentation viewer in the main menu.
## The process of building
*Note: If you simply want to run the program, you can skip step 1 and continue to step 2.*
### Step 1: Download NVGT
The first thing you have to download is NVGT, odviously you need it to be able to build the games.
To download, click this link:
(https://nvgt.gg/downloads/)
Be sure to download the latest version, which at the time of this writing is version 0.86.0.
After you'Ve downloaded NVGT, you can compile the script.
- Go to the context menu when you'Ve selected the main script.
- Press right arrow or enter on the compile submenu.
- Press r to go to the release option, and press enter.
If the compilation process succeeded, a message box will appear, telling you that the executable was saved. But you still have one more thing left before you're done.
### Step 2: Download aria2c
In order to stay up to date with the game's content, it's important that you download the latest release of aria2c. Download from the following link:
(https://github.com/aria/aria2/releases/)
After you've downloaded the latest version, make sure it is in a place where the game can find it, so maybe put it where the main nvgt script is located.
Once you've done that, you are done building.
